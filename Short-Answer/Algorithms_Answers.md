#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  Runtime complexity is `O(n)` because n increases linearly with each step
        <!-- O(1 + (n * 1))
        O(1 + n) ...we always want the highest value
        O(n) -->
<!-- `O(n^3)` The `while` loop seems to run depending on how big `n^3` is -->

b)  Runtime complexity is `O(n)` because the bigger `n` is the longer it will take the code to run linearly.


c)  Runtime complexity is `O(1)` because the amount of bunnies is a constant value no matter how many times it runs.
